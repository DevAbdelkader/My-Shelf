## Technical Talking

---

This project uses the *ISBN Search API* which fetches its title, authors and cover image.
All data is stored in *local storage* in **JSON** format and can be accessed **offline**.
**Book covers** are transcoded into Base64 and stored in local storage, and converted to *data URL* when rendered.
